# Reaktor Assignment

> My Reaktor Assignment for summer internship position.

Demo link [https://reaktor-assignment.marcotornqvist.vercel.app](https://reaktor-assignment.marcotornqvist.vercel.app). The demo might crash when you initially load it since heroku cors-proxy is in sandbox mode which means that the heroku dyno might be sleeping. Wait for 30 seconds and refresh the page and it should work.

npm install
```
